Problem:
In a sliding puzzle a player can only move blocks to adjacent empty slot, the
goal is to arrange all blocks in to a certain pattern. Here is a simple version
of it: Given a 2 x 3 board of numbers from 0 to 5, where 0 represents an empty
slot, our goal is to order the blocks as [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]], only move allowedis
 to swap 0 with one of itâ€™s neighbors in either direction (one of up, down,
 left, right). Given an puzzle we need to return the least number of moves
 needed to solve it, return -1 if it can not be solved.

How the solution works:
The way it works is by starting with the position of the zero (blank space)
creating the next 2-4 possible new board states (moves). These new board
states are added to a queue.
The queue will store new board states in the order they were seen and move
once (in each possible direction) for each of them creating new boards that are
added in line (queue). When a board is removed from the queue, new board states
are created and they are checked to see if they've been seen. If so it can be
disregarded because an indentical version of that board is already waiting
somewhere in line (queue) with fewer steps (this saves a LOT of time, allowing
the program to refrain from repeating unnecessary steps).
During each iteration the boards are also checked to see if they are solved.
If so, their counts of moves is returned along with the moves required. Because
each board is solved one step at a time in order it can be concluded that the
first set of moves found to solve a board is the fastest.

    Calculates the minimum number of moves using breadth first search.
    returns -1 if no solutions exist. It also keeps track of the moves and
    returns a list of the moves (list of (x,y) coordinates of the zero position
    at each step).

    This works by creating a queue to store game board instances, and a set
    to store previous (already seen) game boards. The boards are also stored
    as tuples so they can be added to sets. Next it goes through each board
    in the queue and moves one move at a time creating up to four new boards
    on each move. The boards then get added to a queue with their number of
    moves, so long as they havent been seen. Then they are added to seen.
    Once a board is found that is solved, the number of moves is returned. If
    no board is found then it returns -1 to indicate the puzzle is unsolveable.

    Time complexity: O(n!) The number of possible board permutations from a
    board is is n! / 2. So the maximum number of boards required is n!. This
    algorithm is extremely unscalable. A 3x3 board can take up to 181,440
    iterations though a 3x4 can more than 1000 times longer at 239,500,800
    iterations.
