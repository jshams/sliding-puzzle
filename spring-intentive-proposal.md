# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal


Dates 4/13-5/8

**My Name: Jake Shams** 


**Project Name: Sliding Puzzle Solver** 


**Is your project New or Old? Old**


**Is your project Solo or Team? Solo**


## Description

**Sliding Puzzle is an online playable sliding puzzle game. You can play by clicking on the tiles or using your keyboard keys. If you get stuck there is also an AI button that you can click and watch as the computer solves the puzzle.**

## Challenges I Anticipate

**The biggest challenge I have now is that all my code is in one file and it is extremely hard to navigate. The next challenge is whether solving a 6x6 is even posslible by a computer. In my research I haven't seen any solvers that can solve greater than 5x5 in acceptable time.**

## Skateboard

**ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc.**

**Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.** 

## Bike
**ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use** 

## Car
**ONE additional feature** 


## Personal Achievement Goals:

**I'd like to improve sliding puzzle by implementing the solve for up to 5x5 puzzle boards. The current AI can only solve 3x3 though I already have a python prototype that can solve some 5x5 boards. I'd also like to give the project a file structure. I was having issues with JavaScript import so everything is in one JS file.**
